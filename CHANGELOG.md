------------------------------------------

## Version 4.41.0

## Version 4.37.0
Bottomless Pits and Cutout Tiles are currently disabled in this version, and do nothing. These will be reimplemented later.
This is a fairly massive update, bringing a large internal change. The floor/wall/ceiling tiles are now entirely generated by the BEE2 compiler. This brings the following upgrades:

* Each 1/4 tile can now be set to white/black individually by using Half Wall items, or the new Quarter Tile. Items like panels placed on top will use the tile pattern.
* The texturing algorithm has been greatly improved, so all styles will now have better appearances.
* Tiles will now reshape around items that cover up bits of walls, producing appropriate panel sizes.
* Standing/Reclined Fizzlers can now be connected to a normal fizzler item to make it use that type (with the original removed in the process).
* Clean and Portal 1 Cube Droppers will extend themselves upwards if additional room is present, to improve their aesthetics.
* HMW's placement helper item will now override automatically placed helpers on surfaces, and attach itself properly to angled panels.
* Fizzlers now appear embedded into the wall properly, instead of black surface covering the hole.

Additionally:
* Old Aperture's Angled/Glass Panels, Faith Plates and Stairs have been rebuilt with new models.
* Fizzlers which don't block portal shots (Physics Repulsion Field, Force Deflection Field) now use the full on/off transition animation.
* New models for Old Aperture and Portal 1 Gel Droppers from @Konclan, plus Old Aperture Futbols.
* Fix far too many bugs to list!
