"A set of 3 grates to be used in co-op maps that prevents cubes from being passed through them.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"* 128x128.\n"
"* 128x256.\n"
"* 128x128 Reclined.\n"

"TIP: If the Grate is covering the face of a white surface, use __Light Strips__ around it if needed, since the Grate "
"will cast a small shadow.\n"
"> IMPORTANT NOTE:\n"
"\n"
"* If the Grate is rotated with the adjustment tool so that it's facing a white wall, then Funnels, Light Bridges, "
"Lasers, Fizzlers and Gels can go through it without problems.\n"
"* If the Grate is NOT facing a white wall, almost mentioned items can go through excepting Funnels and Light Bridges."
"\n"
"* All Gel Flow types can go through, except Bombs.\n"
"* This item is not supposed to replace the original Grating entirely, yet it can be used alongside it to supply each "
"other's deficiencies.\n"
"* For more knowledge and tips on how to use the Co-Op Grates and Tractor Beams appropriately, click on __More "
