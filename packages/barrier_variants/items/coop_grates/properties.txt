"Description"
{   
"" "A set of 3 grates to be used in co-op maps that prevents cubes from being passed through them."
"" ""
"" "Available in 3 different sizes:"
"" ""
"" "* 128x128."
"" "* 128x256."
"" "* 128x128 Reclined."
"" ""
"" "TIP: If the Grate is covering the face of a white surface, use __Light Strips__ around it if needed, since the Grate will cast a small shadow."
"" "> IMPORTANT NOTE:"
"" ""
"" "* If the Grate is rotated with the adjustment tool so that it's facing a white wall, then Funnels, Light Bridges, Lasers, Fizzlers and Gels can go through it without problems."
"" "* If the Grate is NOT facing a white wall, almost mentioned items can go through excepting Funnels and Light Bridges."
"" "* All Gel Flow types can go through, except Bombs."
"" "* This item is not supposed to replace the original Grating entirely, yet it can be used alongside it to supply each other's deficiencies."
"" "* For more knowledge and tips on how to use the Co-Op Grates and Tractor Beams appropriately, click on __More Info>>__ at the lower right corner of this window."
