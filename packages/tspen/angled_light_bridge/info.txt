	"Description" "A vertical or horizontal Light Bridge attached to an Angled Panel.

	* This uses the input A/B system, where A controls the panel and B controls the bridge. Start Reversed rotates the bridge.
	* Moving a Light Bridge unfortunately requires it to be disabled, the bridge will reactivate once the movement has finished.
	* The panel surface is always non-portalable, and may be smaller in some styles.
