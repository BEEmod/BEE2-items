		"" "Once destroyed, the output will activate for the specified time, while the target will be automatically replaced. "
		"" "If the target is being continually damaged the output will stay on."
		"" "* Turrets will automatically shoot the target, but they will prioritise the player."
		"" "* If set to infinite, the target will be permanently destroyed."
		"" "* It can be placed on the floor or ceiling, but turrets need to be quite close to reliably hit it."
