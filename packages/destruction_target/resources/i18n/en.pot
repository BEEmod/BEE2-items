"A large wall-mounted target which activates outputs while being damaged. \n"
"Once destroyed, the output will activate for the specified time, while the target will be automatically replaced. \n"
"If the target is being continually damaged the output will stay on.\n"
"* Turrets will automatically shoot the target, but they will prioritise the player.\n"
"* If set to infinite, the target will be permanently destroyed.\n"
"* It can be placed on the floor or ceiling, but turrets need to be quite close to reliably hit it."
