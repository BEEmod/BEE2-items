		{
		"" "Allows cutting circular holes into thin barrier items like Glass or Grating."
		"" ""
		"" "* Place on top of an existing glass/grating surface. (Place onto a wall to rotate to the correct orientation, then drag onto the glass.)"
		"" "    * Unfortunately voxels with an adjacent wall make this difficult. Filling the block in, placing the hole item, then hollowing and adding the glass second will help in some situations."
		"" "* Five variants are available:" 
		"" "* Small holes allow portal shots, bullets, lasers, pellets and gel."
		"" "* Medium holes allow cubes to fit through, but players cannot when placed on walls."
		"" "* Large holes are intended for Excursion Funnels, but most things will fit through."
		"" "* Slot holes come in a centered and offset variant, and are designed to fit a Light Bridge through. Portal shots, bullets, lasers and gel splatter will also fit through."
		"" "* Multiple hole items cannot overlap."
