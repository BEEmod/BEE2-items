"Name"		"ForthReaper's Fizzlers"
"Desc"      "ForthReaper created several fizzler variants in his Penrose series. 
- Compressed Smoke Fields block the player, as well as stopping portals. Cubes are unaffected.
- Force Deflection Fields act similarly to gratings, but they can be turned off.
- Matter Inquisition Fields behave like normal Fizzlers, but do not reset portals when the player passes through."
