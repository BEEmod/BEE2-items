	"Description"
		{
		"" "A fizzler-style field which toggles an output whenever players cross through the field."
		"" ""
		"" "* Players must leave on the opposite side to the one they entered in for it to toggle."
		"" "* Alternatively, set a timer, and each time the player touches the field it will activate for the specified time."
		"" "* This requires use of the Fizzler Output Relay."
		"" "* Note that there are two circumstances when the field will **not properly detect movement** - when players move at exteme speeds via Faith Plate, or if they are able to pass through the side of the field. Avoid high-speed plates, and add walls above/below the field."
		"" "* Inputs may be sent to disable the field. When disabled, the toggle state will persist, while timers will immediately cancel."
