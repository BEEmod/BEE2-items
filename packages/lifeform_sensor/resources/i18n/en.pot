"A fizzler-style field which toggles an output whenever players cross through the field.\n"
"\n"
"* Players must leave on the opposite side to the one they entered in for it to toggle.\n"
"* Alternatively, set a timer, and each time the player touches the field it will activate for the specified time.\n"
"* This requires use of the Fizzler Output Relay.\n"
"* Note that there are two circumstances when the field will **not properly detect movement** - when players move at "
"exteme speeds via Faith Plate, or if they are able to pass through the side of the field. Avoid high-speed plates, "
"and add walls above/below the field.\n"
"* Inputs may be sent to disable the field. When disabled, the toggle state will persist, while timers will "
"immediately cancel."
