"" "A Reclined Fizzler. It is useful for certain scenarios where you want to put the Fizzler covering the face of a single block without having to add two additional blocks at each side of the Fizzler."
"" ""
"" "* Each pillar will match the colour of the surface they are mounted on. Same-coloured pillars can intersect without causing texture overlaps."  
"" "* If any of the pillars is inside of a block, the pillar will not be generated to avoid texture overlaps."
