		"" "Fires portals. Can rotate automatically before being collected by the player. In **Aperture Tag**, Portal Guns cannot be picked up (only firing portals).  "
		"" "* When picked up, autoportals of the same colour permanently deactivate, and the output activates."
		"" "* The player starts the map with whichever portals are not present already (as a pedestal or autoportal)."
		"" "* Portals will not open until after the player enters the map."
		"" "* Weighted fires both (use Start Reversed to choose). If you want the player to start with a single device, use the blue/orange-only gun - on pickup they'll be combined."
		"" "* Cube is blue-only."
		"" "* Sphere is orange-only."
