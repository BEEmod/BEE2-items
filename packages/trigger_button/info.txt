"Desc"      "A button which has a larger trigger radius, to ensure it is always pressed by flung cubes."

// It turns out buttons have a trigger_portal_button entity at their location, which acts as the trigger range.
// We can't spawn them ourselves, but we can change the absize to fiddle with this.
