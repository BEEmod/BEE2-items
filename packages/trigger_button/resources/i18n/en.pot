"A button which has a larger trigger radius, to ensure it is always pressed by flung cubes.  \n"
"Cubes landing anywhere in the block will force-press the button.  \n"
"Only available in a Weighted version, as the other receptacles would not realistically allow inaccurate placement.  \n"
"The button is placed on a 3/4 block, so it can be recessed in the floor to produce a button inside a 1/4 recess."
