		"" "Coats surfaces in a lacquer, preventing gel from being applied to it. Portals can still be applied normally however."

		""
		"" "* This item has three variants, changing how it determines which surfaces to affect."
		"" "* 'Companion' applies to the surface the item is placed on, converting regular tiles on the wall/floor/ceiling."
		"" "* 'Reflect' applies to the whole voxel, converting any block/panel items inside it, but not other regular tiles."
		"" "* 'Weighted' is a combination of both."
		"" "* The item supports connections - linking two together modifies all voxels in the bounding box, and surfaces on the boundary. This depends on the variants that were used."
		"" "* The other two 'cube types' are reserved for future variants."
