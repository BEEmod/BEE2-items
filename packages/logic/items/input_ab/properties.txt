		{
		"" "The Input A/B items converts inputs so they work simultaneously with two separate inputs, similar to funnels. This covers a voxel side."
		"" ""
		"" "* Place one or both in the map and wire them to a dual-input item."
		"" "* Wire normal inputs into Input A/B to control those parts of the dual-input item."
		"" "------"
		"" "The SR Latch is a logic item which memorises its current state."
		"" ""
		"" "* When Input A turns on it is 'set' to an enabled state."
		"" "* When Input B turns on the latch is 'reset' to a disabled state."
		"" "* If both inputs are on, the latch will prefer the most recently activated input."
		"" "* The Start Enabled option controls whether it begins enabled or not."
