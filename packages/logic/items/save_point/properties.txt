		"" "Saves the player's progress when they enter the marked voxel."
		"" "If an input is connected, instead it saves when that is triggered."
		"" "* If a timer is set, this uses the 'dangerous' save mode. The autosave triggers immediately, 
		    but if the player dies before that duration elapses, the autosave is discarded and the previous is used."
		"" "* If Auto-Respawn is enabled, the autosave can be triggered multiple times."
