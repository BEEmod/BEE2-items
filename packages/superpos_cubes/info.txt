"Desc"      "A pair of cubes can be quantum-entangled, swapping position when triggered."

"Item"
	{
	"ID" "ITEM_BEE2_SUPERPOSITION_ENTANGLER"
	"Description"
		{
		"" "Superposition Cubes link a pair of cubes/droppers, causing one to become a ghostly cube which ignores most test elements. "
		"" "When this item is activated, the two cubes swap positions, retaining their momentum and other properties."
		"" ""
		"" "* To create the link, place this entangler on top of one dropper/cube, then connect the entangler's output to the other dropper. "
		"" "* The dropper it is placed on will drop the \"real\" cube, while the conencted dropper will spawn the \"ghost\" cube. "
		"" "* Inputs to the droppers will trigger them as normal, while inputs to the entangler will cause the swap."
		"" "* If either cube is destroyed or not spawned yet, swapping does not function."
		"" "* The **auto-respawn** option controls how fizzling works. If enabled, fizzling one cube fizzles the other immediately."
		"" "* The real cube behaves normally in most respects, while the ghost cube ignores most test elements:"
		"" "  * It cannot press buttons, but Conductive Plates still detect it."
		"" "  * It can pass freely through fizzlers that would normally destroy it, except for the Absolute Fizzler."
		"" "  * It cannot be painted."
		"" "  * It falls through light bridges."
		"" "  * Lasers and High Energy Pellets pass through it."
		"" "  * It ignores faith plates entirely."
		"" "  * Reflection-type ghost cubes do not redirect."
		"" "  * Goo still destroys it like normal, as does crushing it between panels."
