		{
		"" "Allows cutting circular holes into Glass or Grating."
		"" ""
		"" "* Place on top of an existing glass/grating surface. (Place onto a wall to rotate to the correct orientation, then drag onto the glass.)"
		"" "    * Unfortunately voxels with an adjacent wall make this difficult. Filling the block in, placing the hole item, then hollowing and adding the glass second will help in some situations."
		"" "* Use the Start Open property to select the small or large variant." 
		"" "* For large holes, glass must also be present above, below, left and right."
		"" "* Small holes allow portal shots, bullets, lasers, pellets and paint splatter. Large holes allow anything through that physically fits."
		"" "* This also works with grating, although it is less useful."
