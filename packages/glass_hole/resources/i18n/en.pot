"Allows cutting circular holes into Glass or Grating.\n"
"\n"
"* Place on top of an existing glass/grating surface. (Place onto a wall to rotate to the correct orientation, then "
"drag onto the glass.)\n"
"    * Unfortunately voxels with an adjacent wall make this difficult. Filling the block in, placing the hole item, "
"then hollowing and adding the glass second will help in some situations.\n"
"* Use the Start Open property to select the small or large variant.\n"
"* For large holes, glass must also be present above, below, left and right.\n"
"* Small holes allow portal shots, bullets, lasers and paint splatter. Large holes allow anything through that "
"physically fits.\n"
"* This also works with grating, although it is less useful."
