// The scaffold items use a common naming scheme to link up the individual instances, and communicate.
// These use the fact that fixups can appear in the middle of a keyvalue, as long as they are defined.
// The compiler sets $group to a unique number for each scaffold system.
// Then in each instance, $ind is set to the position in the track, and $next to the position of the next
// one (except for the end).

// On the tracktrain, User4 is triggered when it reaches the end.

// The path_tracks use the name pattern "@scaff_track_grp$group_$ind".

// The env_beams use the name pattern "@scaff_beam_grp$group_$ind".

// The citadel cores use the name pattern "@scaff_fx_grp$group", and pass on IO to other bits:
// - User1 is fired to switch to 'deactivated' effects.
// - User2 is fired to switch to 'activated' effects.
// In Old Aperture only:
// - User3 is fired to do reverse activated effects.
// - User4 is fired to stop the spinning motor but keep the beam, when the platform is reversing.
