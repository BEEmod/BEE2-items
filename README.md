* After that, you must go to the [releases page](https://github.com/TeamSpen210/BEE2-items/releases) to download the BEE2.4 Default Pack. **_The releases must match!_**
* Next, you must extract the contents of the zip file to your **BEE2.4 compiler folder**.
* Finally, in order to launch BEE2.4, you must go to the `bin` folder and select `BEE2.exe` and open it. Once opened, you must select the game you want BEE2.4 to modify.

## Development Version

**_These are instructions to install the Development Version of the BEE2.4 Default Pack. This version will receive updates and bug-fixes to the `dev` branch in real time, but may be unstable. It is recommended that you use the Release Version instead._**

* First, you need to install [GitHub Desktop from here](https://desktop.github.com/).
* After installation, you must clone this repository. **_It must be done on [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)!_**
* After cloning, you need to select the `dev` branch and _NOT_ the `master` branch.
* Next, click the `Sync` button.
* Now you must go to the BEE2.4 config folder and open `config.cfg`. **_You must use the latest release of the [BEE2.4 Compiler](https://github.com/BenVlodgi/BEE2.4/releases)!_**
* You must set the package directory to your cloned repository folder. (e.g. `C:\Users\User\Documents\GitHub\BEE2-items`)

# Additional Information

* If you are editing on Hammer, anything that is placed in the folder `sdk_content\maps\instances\bee2` will be deleted if you export the BEE2.4 pallete without enabling the setting `Preserve Game Directories`. If you are editing any package, after you have finished, do not forget to save it inside the packages, by replacing the old files inside.
* BEE2.4 will crash if you are exporting while another folder or file is open that is important to the BEE2.4 compilation process.
* If you are having problems using BEE2.4, make sure to verify the game cache files of Portal 2 before using a new BEE2.4 Default Pack release. **The issue also could be from another BEE2.4 pack, not just the BEE2.4 Default Pack**
* It is recommended to have backups from the following Portal 2 folders: `sdk_content`, `portal2_dlc2`, and `bin`, just in case you need to restore your Portal 2 files.
* You can use the Development Version for other branches, but not at the same time.
